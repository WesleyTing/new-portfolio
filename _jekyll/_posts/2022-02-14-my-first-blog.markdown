**Welcome to my very first blog.**

It's a work in progress, but here's a few things to expect.


## 1. Random Info and Topics

Everybody needs a safe space to let their mind roams. Some choose to journal, and some choose to broadcast their thoughts to the internet, even if no one's listening. 

#### To each their own though, am I right?

But if you're here to read or discuss about everything and nothing at all, you've come to the right place.

And as an added bonus, if you want insight to being a web developer, I've got you covered too.

## 2. Code

What kind of a web developer blog would it be without including some code?

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>How to Create A Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello World</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

But plain ol' code can be just boring to view, so I'll use CodePen whenever I need to show something interactive.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="JjWzeKw" data-user="wesleyting" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/wesleyting/pen/JjWzeKw">
  Hamburger Menu and Overlay</a> by Wesley Ting (<a href="https://codepen.io/wesleyting">@wesleyting</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

And for design, I'll use Figma to show any prototypes or wireframes.

## 3. The Things I Love

Above all, I want to talk about the things I love, and am interested in.

To start off, here's a playlist of my favorite genre, "acoustic".

If you're not a fan of acoustic music, here's a duck playing the drums. 

#### Who could say no to that?
